# **Zack's Plugin** #
This plugin adds 3 new commands to the console.

`AQUA`- Runs a file in native AquaConsole code- supports plugins- Usage: cd [directory of your file] then aqua [filename]
`UPDATE`- Downloads a currently available release (not archive) of AquaConsole- Usage: update [version]
`.` - Similar to an `echo` command in Batch

This plugin depends on *Ionic.Zip* which is distributed with the program. *Ionic* should then be included with the plugin in the Plugins folder. AquaConsole will not recognise Ionic.Zip as a plugin.
There are no exceptions in this plugin so errors besides syntax will lead to an AquaConsole crash.

ZacksPlugin has been updated so builds after this Readme update will require manual building of AquaConsole Dev due to its wider compatabilities.
